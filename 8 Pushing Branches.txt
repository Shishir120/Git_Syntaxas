git checkout Branch_Name 

Basically, we need to switch to the branch which we want to push to remote repository.

git push origin Branch_Name  ---->Pushes branch to remote repository.
 
git push origin Branch_Name:Name_which_we_want_to_save_as_in_github.  ----> Pushes the 
								Branch and save it in
								github in another name.
								(Not Recommended)


git push -d origin Branch_Name ---->It deletes the branch in github.
