1) Firstly open git bash in the folder.

2) Go to github.com and "+" then new repository,
   Write name and all,
   Copy smthg like (git remote add origin https://github.com/Shishir120/Repo_Name.git)
				   This origin is the name of the remote repository.
				    Hence can be changed.

3) Write git remote just to check.

TO get access to your git, we need to add the ssh key of device to the github.
To do this,
Search ssh keys github,
It will show some steps, Few of which are;
	I) Paste ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Your_Email@gmail.com"
	   (Then press enter enter)
	II)Then paste eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	III) Then paste ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa (There might be number in place of rsa, so
	      replace the number with rsa)
	IV) Then Write tail and paste ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
(We get a big code starting with ssh-rsa, copy all and paste it in the ssh key section of
settings in github)


4) To push the directory type git push -u origin master and done.
